## âœ¨ Fork Notice
This is a **fork** of the original [Resources Plus module by ardittristan](https://github.com/ardittristan/5eSheet-resourcesPlus), updated to include [kgar's suggested fix](https://github.com/kgar) to allow referencing **all custom resources** in item usage and consumption settings (not just the first three).

# 5e-Sheet Resources Plus

Resouces Plus allows you to have up to 20 resource fields on actor sheets. These resources have the same functionality as the default resources. The max/shown amount can also be globally in the settings, or locally on the sheet itself.

## Installation

To install, import this [Manifest](https://github.com/jrleavey/5eResourcesPlus-Updated/raw/master/module.json) into your module browser.

&nbsp;

## Usage

A new resource box called "Resource Count" should appear on the character sheets. If you change the number in this box, the amount of visible resources changes. *(up to 20)*
If you want to have the count be the same everywhere, you could change the local count, and if, as a dm, you want to limit all players to a certain max, you can change the global limit setting.
